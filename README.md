# Welcome
Thank you for visiting the Open African Repository project on GitHub.

This document (the README.md file) will give you some information about the project.

The Open African Repository (OAR) is a web plateform (website) that will regroup links to various contents produced by Africans

## Background
Africa produces less than 3% of scientific content in the world (according to UNESCO statistics). But does this mean that these 3% represent all the scientific content produced by Africans?
Not necessarily, when we consider the very small number of platforms or websites devoted to African scientific content.
It would be interesting if we could group all or almost all the sources of scientific content produced by Africans on the same platform.

## Objectives
The OAR is an open source project that aims to create a web platform that will bring together all sources of scientific content produced by Africans.
This platform will be powered by a community of contributors who will, on the one hand, identify the different sources of African scientific content, and on the other hand will propose them for the platform with abstracts.

## Who we are
The open african repository is a project initiated by Justin S. Ahinon (University of Parakou) with the Mozila Open Leaders Initiative. 

## What do we need
You! In whatever way you can help.

We need people who are expert in webdesign and web development, in user experience design, in graphics and digital creation, in video tutorial creation, in africa content. 

## How to contribute
There are many ways to contribute to the project. You can find then in the Contributors Guidelines.
