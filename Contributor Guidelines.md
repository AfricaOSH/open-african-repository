## How can you help?!?

Everyone, thank you for finding your way to the Open African Repository Project
The OAR is an open source project that aims to create a web platform that will bring together all sources of scientific
content produced by Africans

To do this, we want to implement an open-source online platform with the following features:

    OAR Project website
    Discussion Forum
    Rating and Evaluating system

But we're currently working on the structure of this platform.

An Issue was created for each individual feature. Please comment on the individual issue with your ideas and tips or feel 
free to add your own ideas on what might be a helpful feature for an open-source research platform.

If you are contributing to open source for the first time (like us), check out this free series, 
How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub.
